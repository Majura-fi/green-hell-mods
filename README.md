# Green Hell Mods Collection

This project contains multiple Unity Mod Manager mods for the **Green Hell** game.

## Creative Mode

Contains parts made by [Wisnoskij](https://github.com/wisnoskij/GreenHell.CreativeMode). No UI options, just instant build.

Note: Does not build multipart structures, such as walls, fences or bridges.

## Eternal Fire

Torches, camp fires and forges never run out fuel. You can get campfire ash by harvesting charcoal and using the Mud Charcoal Furnace.

## Fast Growing Trees

This mod accelerates the growth of trees, making them grow fully in approximately 41 seconds in real time. This ensures that players will never run out of trees to chop down, as they can focus on cutting down three or four trees at a time while others grow back.

## Sensible Leeches

The game code contains two different chances for leeches, one when the player is in water and other one when the player is NOT in water. Sadly, both of these values are at 50%. This mod reduces dry-land chance from 50% to 5%.

## Super Planter

All planter boxes are always watered and fertilized.
